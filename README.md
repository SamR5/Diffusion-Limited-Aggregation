# Diffusion-Limited-Aggregation
Different kind of Brownian trees

This is a repository with multiple kind of Brownian trees


### DiffusionLimitedAggregation.cpp
A seed is in the center and particles start on the edge of the window

### Snowflake_1.cpp
A seed is in the center, particles start on the right and only move in a cone between -PI/6 and PI/6.  
The particles are rotated and flipped around the center to form a snowflake.  
A line between the touching particles is drawn.  

### snowflake_2.cpp
Same as version 1 but without the lines.  

### todo
 - from top to bottom
 - from center to edges (circular or rectangular)
